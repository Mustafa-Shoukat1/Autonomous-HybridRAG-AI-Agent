## DDGS and AsyncDDGS classes

The DDGS and AsyncDDGS classes are used to retrieve search results from DuckDuckGo.com.
To use the AsyncDDGS class, you can perform asynchronous operations using Python's asyncio library.
To initialize an instance of the DDGS or AsyncDDGS classes, you can provide the following optional arguments:
```python3
class DDGS:
    """DuckDuckgo_search class to get search results from duckduckgo.com

    Args:
        headers (dict, optional): Dictionary of headers for the HTTP client. Defaults to None.
        proxy (str, optional): proxy for the HTTP client, supports http/https/socks5 protocols.
            example: "http://user:pass@example.com:3128". Defaults to None.
        timeout (int, optional): Timeout value for the HTTP client. Defaults to 10.
    """
```

Here is an example of initializing the DDGS class. 
```python3
from duckduckgo_search import DDGS

results = DDGS().text("python programming", max_results=5)
print(results)
```
Here is an example of initializing the AsyncDDGS class:
```python3
import asyncio

from duckduckgo_search import AsyncDDGS

async def aget_results(word):
    results = await AsyncDDGS(proxy=None).atext(word, max_results=100)
    return results

async def main():
    words = ["sun", "earth", "moon"]
    tasks = [aget_results(w) for w in words]
    results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
    print(results)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

## Proxy

Package supports http/https/socks proxies. Example: `http://user:pass@example.com:3128`.
Use a rotating proxy. Otherwise, use a new proxy with each DDGS or AsyncDDGS initialization.

*1. The easiest way. Launch the Tor Browser*
```python3
ddgs = DDGS(proxy="tb", timeout=20)  # "tb" is an alias for "socks5://127.0.0.1:9150"
results = ddgs.text("something you need", max_results=50)
```
*2. Use any proxy server* (*example with [iproyal rotating residential proxies](https://iproyal.com?r=residential_proxies)*)
```python3
ddgs = DDGS(proxy="socks5://user:password@geo.iproyal.com:32325", timeout=20)
results = ddgs.text("something you need", max_results=50)
```

## Exceptions

Exceptions:
- `DuckDuckGoSearchException`: Base exception for duckduckgo_search errors.
- `RatelimitException`: Inherits from DuckDuckGoSearchException, raised for exceeding API request rate limits.
- `TimeoutException`: Inherits from DuckDuckGoSearchException, raised for API request timeouts.

## 1. chat() - AI chat

```python
def chat(self, keywords: str, model: str = "gpt-4o-mini", timeout: int = 30) -> str:

        model (str): The model to use: "gpt-4o-mini", "claude-3-haiku", "llama-3-70b", "mixtral-8x7b".
            Defaults to "gpt-4o-mini".
        timeout (int): Timeout value for the HTTP client. Defaults to 30.

        str: The response from the AI.

It is by far the most important source of energy for life on Earth. The Sun has been an object of veneration in many cultures. It has been a central subject for astronomical research since antiquity. The Sun orbits the Galactic Center at a distance of 24,000 to 28,000 light-years. From Earth, it is 1 AU or about 8 light-minutes away. Its diameter is about 1,391,400 km, 109 times that of Earth. Its mass is about 330,000 times that of Earth, making up about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System. Roughly three-quarters of the Sun's mass consists of hydrogen; the rest is mostly helium, with much smaller quantities of heavier elements, including oxygen, carbon, neon, and iron.",
